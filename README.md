## Images
All the images are already pre-formatted so that they do not weigh so much on the web and you can concentrate on your project ðŸ˜ƒ.
All are with a measure of 858x858

In the json responses we can find an array of images with id and a url, example: 
```
/storage/products/iphone-14-pro-max-2.webp
```

To complete the url of the image you must insert the base domain, example:
```
https://store.innovacode.online/storage/products/iphone-14-pro-max-2.webp
```
